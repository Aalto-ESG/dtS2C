# Scripts for processing datasets from our cluster


Scripts for visualizing data from our Urban Transportation System (UTS) and 
Industrial Logistics Warehouse (ILW) experiments.

## Usage:

1. Collect data from the cluster
2. Process the raw data into a dataset using tools from `dataset-tools`
3. Use scripts in this folder to visualize results from the processed dataset

## Example data:

- Check the ``dataset-tools/readme.md`` for details on downloading and preprocessing example datasets.
  - You can use the example data to get familiar with the tools included in this repository without having to setup a computing cluster.


## Customization

The analysis scripts included here are intended as an example. 
They are meant to be used as a starting point for analyzing experiments run on a cluster.
